Equalify App 

Equalify the web!
96.8% of home pages have WCAG conformance failures.1 Failing WCAG conformance means countless people with disabilities do not have equal access to the internet.

Equalify aims to make websites more accessible. We are building an affordable and easy-to-use platform that integrates your favorite WebOps. All of our work is open source, published under the AGPL. Working this way helps us create the most accessible platform for internet accessibility.
